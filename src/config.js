Do not participate in any training if you have any physical or medical condition that would prevent you from participating in the training or that creates a risk of injury to you. As between Royal Mindfulness and any participant in a training, the participant is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of any training to the participant’s physical capabilities. If you, as a participant, feel that any training (or any portion thereof) is not safe, is not appropriate to your skill level and fitness capabilities, or otherwise poses a risk of harm to you, please do not participate in the training. If you experience faintness, dizziness, pain, or shortness of breath at any time while participating in any training, you should stop immediately. If you are in the United States and think you are having a medical or health emergency, call your health care professional or 911 immediately. You acknowledge and agree, on your own behalf and, if you are an enterprise purchaser, on behalf of your employee users, that any instruction or directions provided by a teacher during a training (including, without limitation, any poses or movements) are optional and provided by way of suggestion only, that such instruction and directions do not constitute health advice, and that if any participant follows any such instruction or directions, the participant does so at the participant’s own election and at the participant’s own risk. The service may offer, through your participation in trainings or otherwise, general health and fitness information which is designed for informational purposes only. Nothing stated or posted on the app or website, stated by any teacher, or otherwise available through the service is intended to be, and must not be taken to be, the practice of medical or professional care. You should not rely on any information available via the service as a substitute for, nor does it replace, professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. If you have any concerns or questions about your health, you should always consult a physician or other health-care professional. Do not ever disregard, avoid, or delay obtaining medical or health-related advice from your health-care professional because of something you may have read on the site or received via the service. The use of any information provided on the service is solely at your own risk. You shall comply (and if you are an enterprise purchaser, you shall require that your employee users comply) at all times with any safety rules and guidelines given by Royal Mindfulness or an applicable teacher. If you are a participant in a training, you should share with your teacher details relating to your level of fitness and any medical conditions or physical limitations that may impact your ability to participate in any training. If Royal Mindfulness or any teacher determines, in its sole discretion and subjective opinion, that your participation in any training or other use of the service may pose a risk of physical harm to you, we may deny you access to the training or service until you furnish to us an opinion letter from a licensed physician, obtained at your sole cost and expense, confirming your physical fitness to undertake the training and service and addressing any specific health or safety concerns raised by Royal Mindfulness or your teacher. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, you understand and acknowledge, on your own behalf and, if you are an enterprise purchaser, on behalf of your employee users, that any permission granted to you (or any employee user) to access the service and any training does not constitute an endorsement by Royal Mindfulness of your (or any employee user’s) fitness to participate in the service or any training and should not be interpreted as indicating an absence of risk. By accessing or using the service in any manner, including, without limitation, by purchasing access to and/or attending or viewing any class, event, activity, or other training (or, if you are an enterprise purchaser, by permitting your employee users to do any of the foregoing), you hereby acknowledge on behalf of yourself, your heirs, personal representatives and/or assigns and, if you are an enterprise purchaser, on behalf of your employee users, that there are certain inherent risks and dangers in participating in yoga, the trainings, and service.

    summary: "The Trainers and Training Services",
    details: `Royal Mindfulness is a platform that enables individuals to access guided mental fitness training, conducted by qualified and experienced Trainers. Each Trainer offers personalized sessions aimed at improving mental clarity, focus, discipline, and emotional control through time-tested mindfulness and meditation-based practices.

Trainers on the platform come from diverse backgrounds — including yoga psychology, mindfulness instruction, behavioral coaching, and contemplative training — and are selected based on their experience, depth of understanding, and ability to guide students through structured practice.

It is important to understand that Royal Mindfulness does not provide clinical therapy, psychotherapy, or medical treatment. The Training Services are designed purely for mental fitness development, and the Trainers may or may not hold licenses as psychologists or psychotherapists in your country. The role of a Trainer is that of a guide and mentor, not a medical professional.

Each Trainer represents the Royal Mindfulness ethos of discipline, awareness, and integrity, and is expected to deliver sessions that promote steady progress in the student’s inner development and practical mental conditioning.

`,

   {
    summary: "Independent Nature of Trainers",
    details: `All Trainers associated with Royal Mindfulness act as independent service providers, not as employees, agents, or representatives of the company. Royal Mindfulness’ function is to maintain and operate the digital platform that connects Trainers and students, facilitates bookings, processes payments, and ensures a seamless administrative experience.

Trainers are solely responsible for the conduct, content, and quality of their sessions. They maintain full independence in their methods of instruction, provided they stay within the ethical and educational framework defined by Royal Mindfulness.

The company does not control or supervise the specific advice, recommendations, or training approaches used by Trainers. If a user feels that the assigned Trainer is not suitable or wishes to change their Trainer, they may request a reassignment through the platform without penalty.

This independent relationship ensures that Trainers have the creative freedom to bring authenticity to their teaching, while users receive personalized, human-centered guidance rooted in the principles of mindfulness, awareness, and inner strength.`,
  },
  {
    summary: "Nature and Scope of Training",
    details: `The purpose of training at Royal Mindfulness is to build mental fitness — which includes developing emotional regulation, focus, calmness under pressure, clarity of thought, and mastery over one’s reactions. These are the skills of the mind that improve life quality, decision-making, and inner stability.

However, it must be clearly understood that the Training Services provided through Royal Mindfulness are not a substitute for mental health treatment, therapy, counseling, or psychiatric care. Trainers do not diagnose, treat, or manage mental health disorders, nor do they prescribe medications or offer medical advice.

The role of a Trainer is to help users strengthen mental awareness and discipline — the same way a physical trainer strengthens the body. The platform’s services are not designed for users in acute psychological distress, crisis situations, or those requiring clinical intervention.

If a user exhibits symptoms of depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts, or any condition that may require medical attention, the Trainer must immediately guide the user to seek professional or emergency medical help. Royal Mindfulness and its Trainers do not provide crisis management or emergency care under any circumstances.`,
  },
    {
    summary: "User Suitability and Limitations",
    details: `While mental fitness training can be transformative for many, it is not universally suitable for all individuals or situations. Each user comes with a unique background, and progress depends on their consistency, mental readiness, and ability to engage with introspective work.

Royal Mindfulness encourages trainers to assess the readiness and appropriateness of users for training sessions. If a trainer believes that a user’s needs are beyond the scope of mental fitness training — such as requiring medical, psychological, or psychiatric intervention — they should advise the user to seek appropriate professional care before continuing further training.

Users must understand that Royal Mindfulness is not a replacement for professional healthcare. It is a training-based service focused on improving mental strength, not treating illness. Trainers and the platform cannot be held responsible for any decisions or outcomes arising from the user’s personal interpretation of the training.

Royal Mindfulness disclaims all liability for any indirect, incidental, or consequential effects of training. Users are expected to engage voluntarily, with full awareness that results depend on their individual commitment and circumstances.`,

    summary: "Platform Usage and Availability",
    details: `Royal Mindfulness strives to provide a smooth and reliable digital experience, but we do not guarantee continuous or uninterrupted access to the Platform or the availability of any specific Trainer at all times. Trainers may take breaks, modify their schedules, or stop offering services at their discretion.

If a Trainer becomes unavailable, Royal Mindfulness will notify affected users and provide options for reassignment to another suitable Trainer. However, the platform cannot guarantee that the replacement Trainer will have identical qualifications, teaching styles, or availability.

Trainers are expected to maintain accurate schedules, respond promptly to booking requests, and conduct sessions as per the agreed timings. Any cancellation or rescheduling must be communicated to both the platform and the user in advance to ensure smooth coordination and uphold the professionalism expected from all Royal Mindfulness Trainers.

     {
    summary: "No Emergency or Crisis Support",
    details: `Royal Mindfulness and its Trainers are not designed to provide crisis intervention, emergency assistance, or medical care. The platform is meant for structured mental training sessions, not for addressing severe emotional or psychiatric emergencies.

If a user discloses that they are in danger, experiencing suicidal thoughts, or showing symptoms of severe mental health crisis, the Trainer must immediately direct the user to contact local emergency services or a qualified mental health professional. Trainers must refrain from attempting to manage or resolve such emergencies themselves.

By using this platform, users acknowledge that Royal Mindfulness is not an emergency resource, and Trainers agree not to provide services outside their training scope.

     {
    summary: "Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability",
    details: `Royal Mindfulness operates as an educational and developmental platform. While the training can result in improved emotional stability, clarity, and focus, the company makes no guarantees about specific outcomes or results.

All sessions are designed to provide mental conditioning and awareness training, but individual progress depends entirely on the user’s effort, discipline, and personal context.

The company and its Trainers shall not be held liable for any damages, losses, or emotional distress resulting from the use or misuse of the Platform or Training Services. The platform is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of income, opportunity, or emotional well-being.

By using the Royal Mindfulness Platform, Trainers and users both acknowledge that they are engaging voluntarily, fully understanding that the services are not medical, psychological, or diagnostic in nature. Participation is entirely at one’s own discretion and risk.`,
